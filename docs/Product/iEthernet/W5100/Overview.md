**Hardwired Dual TCP/IP Stack Controller**

The W5100 chip is a Hardwired TCP/IP embedded Ethernet controller that enables easier Internet connection for embedded systems.

W5100 suits users in need of stable Internet connectivity best, using a single chip to implement TCP/IP Stack, 10/100 Ethernet MAC and PHY. Hardwired TCP/IP stack supports TCP, UDP, IPv4, ICMP, ARP, IGMP, and PPPoE, â€¦, which has been proven through various applications over many years. W5100 uses a 16ytes internal buffer as its data communication memory.

By using W5100, users can implement the Ethernet application they need by using a simple socket program instead of handling a complex Ethernet Controller.

It is possible to use 4 independent hardware sockets simultaneously. BUS (Direct  & Indirect) & SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) are provided for easy integration with the external MCU.
